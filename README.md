# Planning_poker_for_agile_project_management
Planning Poker is a collaborative estimation technique used in agile project management, particularly in Scrum. It helps teams estimate the effort or complexity required for tasks or user stories. 

<h4>Participants:</h4>
Typically involves team members such as developers, testers, and product owners.

<h4>Deck of Cards:</h4>
Each participant has a deck of cards with values. The values usually follow a sequence such as Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL).
<h4>Estimation Process:</h4>

<ul><li>Discussion: The team discusses a user story or task to understand it thoroughly.</li>
<li>Voting: Each team member privately selects a card representing their estimate of the effort or complexity required.</li>
<li>Reveal: All cards are revealed simultaneously to prevent bias.</li>
<li>Discussion and Re-Vote: If estimates vary widely, the team discusses the differences and re-votes until a consensus is reached.</li></ul>
<h4>Benefits:</h4>
<ul><li>
Encourages Collaboration: Promotes discussion and understanding of the task.</li>
<li>Mitigates Bias: The simultaneous reveal helps prevent the influence of stronger personalities.</li>
<li>Provides Diverse Perspectives: Different viewpoints can lead to more accurate estimates.</li></ul>
<h4>Usage:</h4>

<ul><li>Commonly used in sprint planning meetings to estimate the effort required for backlog items.</li></ul>
 
<h4>Example Workflow</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  Introduce the Story: The team discusses the requirements and context of the user story or task.
 </li>
  <li>
  Estimate: Each member selects a card based on their understanding.
 </li>
 <li>
  Reveal: Cards are shown simultaneously.
 </li>
 <li>
  Discuss: Members discuss discrepancies and revise their estimates if necessary.
 </li>
 <li>
  Reach Consensus: A final estimate is agreed upon based on the discussion.
 </li>
</ul>

<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Improves Accuracy: Multiple perspectives lead to more accurate estimates.</li>
 <li>Fosters Team Communication: Encourages team members to voice their opinions and concerns.</li>
 <li>Flexible: Can be adapted to different team sizes and project complexities.</li>
 <li>Planning Poker is a valuable tool for agile teams to collaboratively estimate work and improve the accuracy of their sprint planning.</li>
</ul>
